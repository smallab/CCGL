## The Mac examples

[The CocoaCinderGL wrapper](http://cocoacid.org/mac/) eases the use of Cinder from within a typical XCode/Cocoa project. Thus allowing C++/Obj-C creative coders to build MacOS apps bearing several "Cinder sketches" as well as Cocoa sliders, buttons...

Provided here are examples that need to be placed **within a "CCGL" folder**, inside of one's Cinder folder, at the same level as the "boost" libraries folder, the "samples", etc.
